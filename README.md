# Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning journey repository! This repository is where I document my progress, notes, and projects as I learn Python programming. Whether you're just starting out or are further along in your Python learning, I hope you find something useful here.

## üõ†Ô∏è Learning Resources

This repository includes materials and projects from various learning resources, including online courses, tutorials, books, and personal practice.

- **Courses**: [List the courses you're taking or have completed, e.g., "Programming for Everybody - Coursera"]
- **Books**: [List any books you're using, e.g., "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"]
- **Tutorials**: [List any specific tutorials or websites, e.g., "Real Python tutorials"]

## üìö Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on different topics and projects. Here‚Äôs a basic outline:



## üìù Learning Notes

- **[Basics](Basics/Lecture_Notes.md)**: Covers fundamental concepts like variables, data types, control structures, and basic functions.
- **[Intermediate](Intermediate/Lecture_Notes.md)**: Delves into more complex topics such as object-oriented programming, file handling, and exceptions.
- **[Advanced](Advanced/Lecture_Notes.md)**: Focuses on advanced Python features like decorators, generators, and metaprogramming.

## üíª Code Examples & Exercises

Each folder contains `.py` files with code examples and exercises that correspond to the topics covered in my notes. These examples help reinforce the concepts and provide hands-on practice.

- **Basics/examples.py**: Contains basic Python
